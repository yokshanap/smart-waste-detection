# smart-waste-detection
An AI-powered Smart Waste Detection system using Roboflow and Python. This project identifies and classifies types of waste (like metal, plastic, cardboard, etc.) in images using a custom-trained object detection model. Built with OpenCV, Supervision, and the Roboflow API, this tool enables easy integration for smart waste segregation applications.
